    # lld is here because `kira build --target` has to link the object it just
    # emitted, and the driver only picks a linker — it does not contain one.

    # object to whatever it finds: on a Windows host that is a PE linker, which
    # answers "unrecognised emulation mode: elf_x86_64" and names nothing about
    # the build. lld links every format Kira emits from every host it runs on,
    # which is the only arrangement under which a target is a property of the
    # compiler rather than of the machine it happens to be installed on.
