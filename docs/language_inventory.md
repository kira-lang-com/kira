# Language Inventory

This file tracks the frontend surface implemented in the compiler today. The language target is the Kira design model, not the small checked-in example corpus.

## Implemented Frontend Surface

- Top-level declarations: `import`, `construct`, `class`, `struct`, `annotation`, `capability`, `function`, and construct-defined declaration forms such as `Widget Button(...) { ... }`
- Documentation comments: consecutive `///` lines immediately preceding a declaration or member
- Annotation syntax: bare annotations, namespaced annotations, annotation arguments, and block-form annotations
- Annotation declarations: parameter schemas, `targets: ...`, `uses CapabilityName`, and explicit `generated { ... }` function members
- Capability declarations: reusable generated function members composed into annotations
- Core execution annotations with compiler semantics: `@Main`, `@Native`, `@Runtime`
- Type execution annotations: `@Native` and `@Runtime` on `struct` and `class`, with structs reserved for execution-boundary and compiler FFI annotations only
- FFI annotations with compiler semantics: `@FFI.Extern`, `@FFI.Callback`, `@FFI.Pointer`, `@FFI.Struct`, plus zero-filled explicit construction for `@FFI.Struct { layout: c; }` values
- Native callback-state expressions with compiler semantics: `nativeState(value)`, `nativeUserData(state)`, and `nativeRecover<Type>(raw_ptr)`
- Function syntax: parameters, function types such as `(Float) -> Void`, optional return types, blocks, `let`/`var`, inferred local declarations, explicit typed local declarations with or without initializer expressions, strict declared-type matching for annotated initializers, expression statements, `return`, calls, and direct trailing callback blocks such as `app.onFrame { frame in ... }`
- Construct-qualified `any ConstructName` type qualifiers for later dynamic dispatch; `any` is rejected for classes, primitives, aliases, and other non-construct symbols.
- Class inheritance: comma-separated `extends` lists, inherited field/method lookup, parent-qualified member access, exact-signature method overrides, and inherited field-default overrides
- Struct declarations: non-inheriting value shapes with stored members, default values, and methods
- Expressions: integer, float, string, boolean, arrays, named/nested struct literals, unary operators, binary operators, grouped expressions, member access, namespaced references, indexing, call syntax, named function references, inline callback values, and callable-value invocations
- Conditional expressions `condition ? then : else`
- Trailing callbacks are native call syntax, for example `graphics.run { frame in frame.draw() }`,
  `graphics.runWithConfig(config) { frame in ... }`, and zero-parameter `app.tick { in update() }`; the trailing block binds as the final function-typed call argument.
  Trailing callbacks may capture surrounding locals: immutable `let` bindings are captured by value, while mutable `var` bindings are captured as shared mutable storage.
  Nested callbacks and multiple callbacks share mutable captures according to lexical scope across `vm`, `hybrid`, and `llvm`.
  This syntax does not introduce standalone callback literals beyond the existing inline callback-value surface.
- Control flow syntax: `if`, `else if`, `for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`, and `switch` in statement position, plus `if`/`else if`, `for`, and `switch` in builder/content contexts
- Construct sections: `annotations`, `modifiers`, `requires`, `lifecycle`, `builder`, `representation`, plus custom sections preserved structurally
- Builder/content blocks with sequential composition, control-flow builder items, and preserved nested trailing-builder child trees on call expressions
- Lifecycle hook forms such as `onAppear()`, `onDisappear()`, and `onChange(of: value) { ... }`
- Type inference plus explicit uninitialized declarations and strict annotated-initializer matching
- Migration diagnostics for removed legacy declaration and documentation syntax
- Construct-driven semantic checks for declared annotations, lifecycle hooks, and required `content { ... }`

## Current Executable Lowering Boundary

The frontend and semantic model understand the broader language surface above. The shared executable IR and current VM/LLVM/hybrid lowering now execute the ordinary language core used by the checked-in parity and interop corpus:

- `@Main`, `@Runtime`, `@Native`
- `function`
- integer, float, string, and boolean literals
- local `let`
- identifier loads
- integer `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- float `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- unary `-` on integers and unary `!` on booleans
- unary `-` on floats
- integer, float, and boolean comparisons in the lowered executable subset
- short-circuit `&&` and `||` on booleans
- conditional expressions in the lowered scalar/pointer subset
- array literals, array locals, array params/returns, indexing, indexed assignment, and `for` iteration over array values
- statement-form `if`
- statement-form `while`, `break`, and `continue`
- statement-form `for` over array literals
- statement-form `switch`
- builtin `print`, including named-struct formatting and array summaries across `vm`, `llvm`, and `hybrid`
- direct function calls with arguments and results in the lowered scalar/pointer subset
- `return` with or without a value in the lowered scalar/pointer subset
- block statements
- lowered named-struct construction, field access, and struct methods across `vm`, `llvm`, and `hybrid`
- lowered zero-filled `@FFI.Struct { layout: c; }` construction through both `Type()` and `Type { ... }`, with omitted C-layout fields preserved as zero
- lowered inheritance dispatch across `vm`, `llvm`, and `hybrid`, including multiple parents, imported parents, parent-qualified field/method access, inherited method calls, and inherited field-default overrides
- explicit FFI extern declarations
- callback-typed arguments targeting native/external functions
- `RawPtr`, `CString`, and callback/pointer typedefs used by the current FFI path
- boxed callback-state handles for Kira-owned native userdata transport, with typed field-oriented recovery across `llvm` and `hybrid`
- function types, named function references, inline callback literals, direct trailing callbacks, immutable by-value callback captures, shared mutable `var` callback captures, nested captures, and callable-value invocations through locals and fields across the shared executable backends

`kirac check`, `kirac ast`, and `kirac tokens` operate on the broader frontend. `kirac run` and `kirac build` use the shared executable lowering across VM, LLVM/native, and hybrid backends rather than treating LLVM/native as a permanently tiny subset.

Executable arrays currently use a shared handle-based runtime representation. The VM and the native/text-LLVM path agree on the same array object layout, so array locals, params, returns, and `for` iteration stay in parity across `vm`, `llvm`, and `hybrid`.

## Design Boundary

- The compiler implements language mechanisms needed by construct-defined libraries, including Kira UI-style builder/content semantics and preserved nested child trees.
- The compiler does not hardcode the full UI framework, design packs, or branded theming/runtime behavior in Zig.
- Higher-level framework behavior remains a Kira/library concern once the language surface has been validated and modeled.

## Dedicated Sibling Surfaces

- `.ksl` is now a real dedicated shader language surface rather than an extension of the executable `.kira` frontend.
- The implemented pipeline lives in [docs/ksl.md](ksl.md) and the dedicated packages `kira_ksl_syntax_model`, `kira_ksl_parser`, `kira_ksl_semantics`, `kira_shader_ir`, `kira_shader_model`, and `kira_glsl_backend`.
- KSL v1 currently parses, validates, reflects, and lowers graphics shaders to GLSL 330.
- Compute shaders are part of the source language and semantic model, but the current GLSL 330 backend rejects them intentionally with a clear diagnostic because the repo's real graphics stack today is Sokol/OpenGL graphics-only shader source.
