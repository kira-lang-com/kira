//! Lowers shader IR to SPIR-V.
//!
//! Layer 4 of the Kira package graph.
//!
//! Emits **one module per stage** and, alone among the backends here, emits
//! binary rather than source: SPIR-V is the format Vulkan consumes, so the
//! output is a word stream and not a string a driver would have to parse.
//!
//! # What a stage's module holds
//!
//! A SPIR-V entry point returns nothing and takes nothing. A stage's interface
//! is module-scope `Input` and `Output` variables instead, one per interface
//! member, carrying either a `Location` or a `BuiltIn` decoration. So the entry
//! reads every input variable and composes the struct the KSL body was written
//! against, and takes the returned struct apart into the output variables on the
//! way out — the same marshalling the GLSL backend does with loose `in`/`out`
//! variables, for the same reason.
//!
//! Every local is a function-scope variable, loaded and stored through. KSL
//! rebinds a `let` freely, so the alternative is building phi nodes at every
//! join; a driver's optimizer undoes this in its first pass.
//!
//! # Layout is said out loud
//!
//! A buffer-facing struct carries an explicit `Offset` on every member, a
//! matrix carries `ColMajor` and a `MatrixStride`, and a runtime array carries
//! an `ArrayStride` — all of them this workspace's own layout rather than
//! anything SPIR-V would default to. A driver reads what these say, so a module
//! that left them out would be rejected, and one that got them wrong would read
//! the host's bytes at the wrong offsets and show it as a wrong image.
//!
//! That is also why a struct reaches the module twice when a buffer holds it:
//! `Offset` is illegal on a struct in the function storage class and `Block` is
//! illegal outside a buffer, so the local's form and the buffer's form cannot be
//! one type.
