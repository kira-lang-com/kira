//! Generating Kira bindings from a native library's C headers.
//!
//! A `NativeLibrary` declaration says how to *link* a C library and, when it
//! carries an `autobind` record, what to *call* in it. This module reads the
//! second half: it parses the declared headers with the managed toolchain's own
//! clang and writes one Kira source file of `@FFI.Extern` functions and the
//! `@FFI.*` types their signatures need.
//!
//! # Why the compiler generates them rather than a person
//!
//! A hand-written binding is a copy of a header, and a copy drifts. The width
//! of a `long`, the order of a struct's fields, whether a pointer is `const` —
//! each is part of the C contract and none of it is visible at the call site
//! that got it wrong. Worse, the copy has to exist before the program compiles,
//! so a package that ships headers and no bindings does not build at all on a
//! machine that has not run a generator by hand.
//!
//! # What this module does not do
//!
//! It does not link, and it does not compile C. `super::native_libraries`
//! resolves archives and `super::native_sources` builds them; a library's
//! headers are read here and nowhere else. It also never decides *when* to run:
//! the build drives it, once, before semantic analysis.
