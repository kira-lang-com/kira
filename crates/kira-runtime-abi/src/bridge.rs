//! The value ABI for calls that cross the runtime/native boundary.
//!
//! A [`BridgeValue`] is how one Kira value is handed between the VM and native
//! code in either direction. It is deliberately a *flat, 16-byte, union-free*
//! struct: a tag plus one 64-bit payload word.
//!
//! - Union-free, because a union's active field is only knowable from the tag,
//!   and native code on the other side of this boundary is free to write a tag
//!   this crate has never heard of. One payload word that each type encodes
//!   itself into is checkable; a union is not.
//! - 16 bytes with an explicit reserved gap, so the payload is 8-byte aligned
//!   on every host without the compiler choosing padding for us.
//!
//! # Wire contract
//!
//! This layout is shared with generated native code and is append-only: never
//! renumber a tag, never change the size, never repurpose the reserved bytes
//! without a new tag. The layout tests in this file are the guard.

/// How a [`BridgeValue`]'s payload should be read.
///
/// A plain byte, not a Rust `enum`: native code writes this field, and a Rust
/// `enum` holding a discriminant it never declared would be undefined
/// behaviour. Unknown tags decode to `None` rather than trapping.
