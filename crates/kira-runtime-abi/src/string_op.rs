//! The string operations that travel as one opcode with an operand byte.
//!
//! Kira's first string primitives — `count`, `charAt`, `indexOf`,
//! `substring` — each took an opcode of their own. That is affordable four
//! times and wasteful thereafter: the opcode space is one byte, and a language
//! that expects to keep growing its string surface should not spend a scarce
//! number every time it does.
//!
//! So these share a single `StringOp` instruction and are told apart by the
//! byte that follows it, exactly as [`FileSystemOp`](crate::FileSystemOp),
//! `TaskPrim` and `CompilerOp` already are. A new string operation costs a
//! number in *this* enum and nothing in the opcode table.
//!
//! # Why these operations and not others
//!
//! Every one of them answers a question about text that a program cannot
//! answer for itself without writing a loop. `contains` is expressible as
//! `indexOf(n) >= 0` and `startsWith` as a `substring` compare, but a language
//! whose users must derive those has a string type in name only — and each
//! derivation scans the text twice where the primitive scans it once.

/// Which string operation one `StringOp` instruction performs.
///
/// The discriminants are a wire contract: they travel in the operand byte of
/// the `StringOp` bytecode instruction, so they are **append-only** — a new
/// operation takes the next free number and no existing one ever moves.
