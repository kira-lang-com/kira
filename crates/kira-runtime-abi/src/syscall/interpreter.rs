    /// Whether an interpreter can serve this call on the program's behalf.
    ///
    /// A property of what the call *does*, which is why it lives on the call
    /// rather than on the host that serves it: no host is in a position to
    /// answer it differently, because the fact underneath is the same for all
    /// of them — **under the interpreter the process is the interpreter, not
    /// the program.**
    ///
    /// The three that answer yes take a descriptor and say what they did.
    /// Serving one is indistinguishable from the program having made it, so a
    /// `--backend vm` run of a program that only reads, writes, or waits on
    /// descriptors can be compared byte for byte against a native run — which is
    /// the oracle a `@FFI.Syscall` otherwise has none of.
    ///
    /// Taking a descriptor is the whole of the test, and it is a narrower test
    /// than "acts on files". A call the program hands one of its own open
    /// descriptors to cannot reach past what the program already had; a call
    /// that takes none is bounded by nothing smaller than the machine.
    ///
    /// The rest act on the process itself or on the machine, and there the
    /// difference between the interpreter and the program is the whole failure:
    ///
    /// - `wait4` reaps the *interpreter's* children, so a program waiting for
    ///   one it started sees a process it never spawned, or blocks forever.
    /// - `exit_group` ends the interpreter in the middle of the program it is
    ///   running — under `kira test` that is the runner, and the rest of the
    ///   suite never reports.
    /// - `execve` replaces the interpreter's image, so the VM ceases to exist
    ///   and there is nothing left to hand the program's result back to.
    /// - `mount`, `umount2` and `reboot` act on the developer's real machine.
    ///   `kira run --backend vm` on an init would mount over their filesystem
    ///   and power the machine off.
    /// - `sync` is that same argument, and sat on the wrong side of it until it
    ///   flushed a real machine. It takes no descriptor: it writes back every
    ///   filesystem mounted on the box, so what it acts on is the developer's
    ///   machine rather than the program's open files. `fsync(fd)` is the call
    ///   that would belong here. Overreach is not the worst of it — over a 9p
    ///   `/mnt/c` the flush parks in the kernel uninterruptibly, so a run that
    ///   reaches it cannot be killed and `timeout` does not end it.
    ///
    /// None of that applies to the code generator's lowering, where the process
    /// really is the program — so this narrows one engine and changes nothing
    /// about `--backend llvm` or the native half of `--backend hybrid`.
