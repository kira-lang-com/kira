//! What an enum box's type-erased payload word is, at the native ABI.
//!
//! A Kira enum crosses the native boundary as a tag plus one word. That word is
//! sometimes inert bits (a scalar payload), sometimes an owned string handle,
//! and sometimes an owned nested-enum handle — and the runtime's clone and free
//! have to know which, because the box does not carry the payload's type.
//!
//! This tag is what they read. It lives here rather than in either crate that
//! uses it because *both* sides are compiled separately and must agree: the
//! LLVM backend writes the value into every `kira_rt_enum_new` call it emits,
//! and the runtime archive interprets it in `kira_rt_enum_clone` and
//! `kira_rt_enum_free`. A disagreement is silent — the symbols still resolve and
//! the box simply forgets to reclaim its payload — so one definition serves
//! both.
//!
//! Append-only, like every wire tag here: a new kind goes on the end, and an
//! unrecognized one is treated as owning nothing rather than guessed at.

///
/// A transparent newtype rather than a Rust `enum` because foreign code writes
/// this byte: an out-of-range discriminant in a Rust `enum` is undefined
/// behavior, while an unknown value here is simply a value the runtime declines
/// to interpret.
