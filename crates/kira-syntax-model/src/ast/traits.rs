//! Trait declarations and the conformance clause every declaration form shares.
//!
//! A trait names a set of members a type may promise to present. A member with
//! no body is a **requirement**; a member with a body is an inheritable
//! **default** a conforming type may replace. Nothing here is a runtime shape:
//! conformance is resolved statically, so a call on a conforming value lowers
//! to an ordinary direct call and no backend learns traits exist.
//!
//! Two clauses can follow a declaration's name, in this order and with these
//! meanings, everywhere both are legal:
//!
//! ```text
//! class Panel: Drawable, Drop extends Surface { … }
//! //          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ conformance      ^^^^^^^ parent
//! ```
//!
//! `:` is *always* conformance and `extends` is *always* a parent. That is why
//! [`TraitRef`] is one node reused by [`StructDecl`](super::StructDecl),
//! [`ClassDecl`](super::ClassDecl), [`ConstructDecl`](super::ConstructDecl), and
//! [`ExtendDecl`](super::ExtendDecl) rather than four clause types that would
//! each have to restate the rule.
