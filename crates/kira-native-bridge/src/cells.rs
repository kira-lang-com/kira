//! The native capture-cell runtime: shared, mutable storage for a captured
//! `var`.
//!
//! # What a cell is
//!
//! A closure that captures a mutable binding has to see the enclosing frame's
//! writes, and the frame has to see the closure's. Nothing else in this runtime
//! shares mutable storage — a struct copies deeply, a string is never written
//! after it is built, and an array's block is shared only until a writer buys
//! its own — so a cell is a new shape rather than an existing one reused.
//!
//! # The box is an enum box
//!
//! [`KiraEnum`] is `{ tag, payload_kind, payload, shares }`. A cell needs
//! everything but the tag, so a cell **is** one of those boxes with the tag left
//! at zero. That is not a shortcut: it means the share bump generated code
//! emits inline, the payload-kind switch that decides what a release reclaims,
//! and the free path itself are all the ones enums already proved, with no
//! second ownership implementation to keep in step.
//!
//! ```text
//!   payload_kind  what `payload` is, and so what a read and a release owe it
//!   payload       the held value, type-erased into one word
//!   shares        how many values hold this box
//! ```
//!
//! # The contract these symbols keep
//!
//! - **A read is owned.** [`kira_rt_cell_get`] hands back a value the caller
//!   releases, cloning a `String`, enum, or erased payload on the way out. A
//!   borrowing read would let a write through another holder free the payload
//!   while the caller still had it — and a cell exists precisely so that other
//!   holders exist.
//! - **A write is one call.** [`kira_rt_cell_set`] releases the old payload and
//!   stores the new one, in that order, with nothing between them. Two calls
//!   would leave the box holding a freed handle for the window in between, and
//!   a trap in that window leaves it there for good. Nothing is ever handed a
//!   pointer *into* the payload slot, for the same reason.
//! - **A wide value goes out of line.** A struct or an array payload is
//!   [`PAYLOAD_AGGREGATE`]: erased bytes plus the clone and free leaves the
//!   backend generated for that concrete type, exactly as an enum's struct
//!   payload works.
//!
//! # Cycles leak
//!
//! A cell holding a closure that captures the same cell is a genuine reference
//! cycle, and share counts cannot collect one. The box and everything it
//! reaches leak: memory-safe, never freed twice, never freed early, and never
//! reclaimed. Collecting it needs a tracing collector this runtime does not
//! have, so it is recorded rather than defended against.
//!
//! Every symbol here is `extern "C"` with a `kira_rt_` prefix and a fixed
//! signature. These names are a wire contract with the backend's lowering and
//! are append-only: never rename one or change a signature in place.
