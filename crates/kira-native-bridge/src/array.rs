//! The native array runtime: allocation, bounds checking, growth, and the
//! share-on-read/copy-on-write pair.
//!
//! # ABI
//!
//! A Kira array crosses the boundary as a [`KArray`]: an *opaque owned handle*,
//! one pointer, never an aggregate — the same discipline [`crate::runtime`]'s
//! `KStr` follows, and for the same reason. The header behind it is
//! `#[repr(C)]` because the backend reads two of its fields directly, so the
//! two are compiled separately against one layout.
//!
//! ```text
//!   len     how many elements are live
//!   cap     how many the item block has room for
//!   items   the element storage
//!   shares  how many values hold this header
//! ```
//!
//! # Copy on write
//!
//! Value semantics say a copy is independent; they do not say when the copying
//! happens. [`kira_rt_array_clone`] hands back the same header with one more
//! share, so **a copy allocates nothing at all**, and the first write through a
//! shared header is what builds that writer a header and a block of its own.
//!
//! ```text
//!   xs ─┐
//!       ├─▶ { len cap items shares:2 } ──▶ [ e0 e1 e2 … ]
//!   ys ─┘
//! ```
//!
//! Reading an array used to cost the whole array — every element, and every
//! string, array and enum inside every element, cloned and then dropped again.
//! A UI frame is mostly such reads, and they were 78% of one.
//!
//! # A write is given the slot, not the handle
//!
//! Making a header unique replaces it, so a write has to reach whatever *holds*
//! the handle rather than the handle itself: [`kira_rt_array_slot_mut`] and
//! [`kira_rt_array_push_slot`] take `*mut KArray` — the local, the field, or the
//! outer array's element the handle lives in — and store the fresh header back
//! into it.
//!
//! That costs the caller nothing, because every write already starts from a
//! place: the backend's place walk loads the handle *out of* that slot, and now
//! passes the slot instead. It is also what keeps `xs.append(v)` visible through
//! a `borrow mut` parameter, which is a pointer to the caller's slot — the
//! callee's append replaces the header the caller can see.
//!
//! A block belongs to exactly one header, since the write that splits a header
//! copies the block with it, so nothing but the header is ever counted.
//!
//! The count is a plain `usize`, not an atomic: the runtime is single-threaded,
//! as its string and enum storage already assume.
//!
//! # Why the element type is a size and a callback, not a type
//!
//! These helpers are generic over the element type, so the backend emits one
//! call rather than one copy of this code per array type. Everything here needs
//! to know is:
//!
//! - **how big an element is** (`esize`), which the backend takes from LLVM's
//!   own ABI size for the element type, so the stride is the target's answer
//!   and not a guess made here;
//! - **how to clone and free one**, which arrives as a function pointer the
//!   backend emits — a two-instruction leaf for a `String`, a walk for a
//!   struct. A null callback means the element owns nothing, and then the flat
//!   `memcpy` a copy starts with is already the whole job.
//!
//! That split is what keeps the *loop* in Rust, where it is ordinary code, and
//! leaves LLVM emitting only leaves.
//!
//! # Ownership
//!
//! Affine, mirroring the VM's heap: reading an array copies it
//! ([`kira_rt_array_clone`]), and a local leaving scope or being overwritten
//! frees it ([`kira_rt_array_free`]). A well-formed program releases every hold
//! exactly once — the same guarantee the VM proves with its heap accounting —
//! and the elements go with the last of them.
//!
//! Every symbol is `extern "C"` with a `kira_rt_` prefix and a fixed signature.
//! These names are a wire contract with the backend's lowering and are
//! append-only: never rename one or change a signature in place.
