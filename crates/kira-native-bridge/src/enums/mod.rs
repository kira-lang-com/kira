//! The native enum runtime: a boxed tag plus a type-erased payload, with the
//! affine clone/free pair.
//!
//! # ABI
//!
//! A Kira enum crosses the boundary as a [`KEnum`]: an *opaque owned handle*,
//! one pointer, never an aggregate — the same discipline [`crate::runtime`]'s
//! `KStr` and [`crate::array`]'s `KArray` follow, and for the same reason. The
//! box behind it is `#[repr(C)]` because the backend and this crate are
//! compiled separately and have to agree on it.
//!
//! ```text
//!   tag           the variant's discriminant, the value `==` compares
//!   payload_kind  what `payload` is, and so what clone/free owe it
//!   payload       the variant's single payload, type-erased into one word
//! ```
//!
//! # Why the payload is one word plus a kind, not a type
//!
//! The box is generic over the variant's payload type. A scalar (`Int`,
//! `Float`, `Bool`) fits one word directly — the backend passes its bits and
//! this code copies them, owning nothing. A `String` payload is an owned `KStr`
//! handle, and a *nested enum* payload is an owned [`KEnum`] handle. A struct or
//! array is wider, so its word points to aligned erased bytes plus clone/free
//! leaves.
//! [`KiraEnum::payload_kind`] lets one clone/free pair serve every case without
//! carrying compiler type metadata: the kind says how to interpret and reclaim
//! that word.
//!
//! A nested enum is what `Result`-shaped values are made of — `Error` carries
//! the failure enum — so `attempt`/`try`/`handle` is the construct that needs
//! [`PAYLOAD_ENUM`]. A struct or array payload uses [`PAYLOAD_AGGREGATE`]: its
//! word points to aligned bytes plus compiler-generated clone/free leaves,
//! allowing recursive construct-family values without baking compiler type
//! metadata into runtime.
//!
//! # Ownership
//!
//! Affine, mirroring the VM's heap: reading an enum copies it
//! ([`kira_rt_enum_clone`]), and a local leaving scope or being overwritten
//! frees it ([`kira_rt_enum_free`]). A well-formed program frees every
//! allocation exactly once — the guarantee the VM proves with its heap
//! accounting.
//!
//! # A copy is a share
//!
//! **A box is never written through.** Every read here — [`kira_rt_enum_tag`],
//! [`kira_rt_enum_payload`], [`kira_rt_enum_payload_aggregate`] — leaves the box
//! exactly as it found it and hands back a value the caller owns, because a
//! variant is replaced whole rather than edited. So a copy needs no new box at
//! all: [`kira_rt_enum_clone`] adds a share and gives back the same handle, and
//! [`kira_rt_enum_free`] releases the payload with the last of them.
//!
//! That is the whole of it — no make-unique, and nothing for the backend to
//! route, unlike [`crate::array`], where a block *is* written through. What it
//! removes is a `malloc`, a deep copy of the payload, and a matching `free` on
//! every read of every enum: a layout descriptor's sizing modes and alignments
//! are payload-less and were already free, but its insets, colours and text
//! runs are not, and they were the largest cost left in a Project Matter frame.
//!
//! The count is a plain `usize`, not an atomic: the runtime is single-threaded,
//! as its string and array storage already assume.
//!
//! Every symbol is `extern "C"` with a `kira_rt_` prefix and a fixed signature.
//! These names are a wire contract with the backend's lowering and are
//! append-only: never rename one or change a signature in place.
