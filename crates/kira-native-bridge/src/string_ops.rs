//! The native half of the shared-opcode string operations.
//!
//! One helper per [`StringOp`](kira_runtime_abi::StringOp), each answering
//! exactly what the VM's `perform_string_op` answers for the same input — that
//! agreement is the whole point, and the backend-parity suite is what proves it
//! rather than this comment.
//!
//! Separate from `runtime.rs` because that file is already past the size where
//! a module should be split, not because these belong anywhere else: they are
//! runtime helpers like every other `kira_rt_*`.
//!
//! # Ownership
//!
//! Every helper takes its arguments by handle and frees all of them, exactly as
//! `kira_rt_str_index_of` does. A caller emits the call and forgets the
//! operands; nothing here is borrowed past the call.
//!
//! # Text, not bytes
//!
//! These operate on `str`, not `[u8]`, because `trim`, `lowercase` and
//! `uppercase` are defined on characters and answering them per byte would be
//! wrong for every non-ASCII input. A handle whose bytes are not UTF-8 cannot
//! come from a Kira `String`, so the conversion is lossless in practice; the
//! lossy fallback is there so a corrupted handle degrades instead of trapping.
