//! The export surface a library module offers its consumer.
//!
//! A `@Export` function is the one thing in a Kira library a Rust consumer can
//! name, and [`ExportTable`] is how a compiled module says so: the consumer name,
//! the function it resolves to, and the shape of the call. It is a *serialized*
//! table rather than something regenerated from source, because the consumer's
//! generated wrapper is built once and then checked against the artifact it was
//! built from — data is the only guard available on that side, so the data has to
//! be in the module.
//!
//! # Why the section is appended rather than woven in
//!
//! KBC1 is append-only. This section sits after the function table, at the end of
//! the stream, so a module written before exports existed decodes as exactly what
//! it is: a module with no exports. Nothing about the existing bytes moves.
//!
//! # What a handle is doing in a bytecode module
//!
//! An exported class's instances cross to the consumer as opaque handles
//! ([`BridgeValueTag::HANDLE`]), and a handle is worth nothing without knowing
//! *which* class it denotes — the consumer mints one Rust newtype per exported
//! class, and a handle typed only as "a word" would let a `Button` be passed
//! where a `Window` was wanted. So the table carries a class list, and a handle
//! type indexes it.
