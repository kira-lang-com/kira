//! The Kira VM instruction set and its byte encoding.
//!
//! The interpreter executes the decoded [`Instruction`] form (match-in-loop),
//! while [`encode`]/[`decode`] provide the on-the-wire byte format. Opcodes are
//! Kira-owned, closed tags with explicit `u8` discriminants; the encoding is
//! **append-only** — new instructions take the next free opcode and existing
//! ones never move.
//!
//! Jump targets are absolute instruction indices within a function's code, so
//! the interpreter sets its program counter directly with no offset math.
//!
//! This module owns the *definitions* — the instruction set, the place-path
//! types, and the opcode constants. [`codec`] owns the only code that turns
//! them into bytes and back, so the append-only contract has one place to be
//! honored on each side.
