//! Kira links libffi rather than shipping it. A user downloads Kira and has the
//! engine already: there is no `libffi.so.8` beside an artifact to lose, no
//! library search path that could find a different one, and no version on the
//! machine that could shadow the version Kira was built against.
//!
//! What that costs is this script. A static archive has to exist for the machine
//! being compiled *for*, at build time — so a cross build needs an archive it
//! cannot produce from the host's, and the answer is `knvm install libffi`,
//! which fetches the one the libffi fork's CI published for that target.
//!
//! The target is read from `CARGO_CFG_*` rather than from `cfg!`, because this
//! script runs on the host and links for the target, and those are not the same
//! machine on any cross build.
