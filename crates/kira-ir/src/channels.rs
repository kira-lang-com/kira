//! The synthesized channel receiver: waiting, written as IR rather than as
//! runtime code.
//!
//! `receiver.receive()` lowers to a call to one of the functions this module
//! builds, and those functions reach the channel table through
//! [`IrExpr::ChannelOp`] and nothing else. Every backend therefore runs the
//! *same* wait: the VM interprets these functions and the native backend
//! compiles them, so "when does a receive come back" cannot drift between
//! engines, because there is only one copy of it and it is not in either
//! engine.
//!
//! This is the same argument [`crate::tasks`] makes, and it is made the same
//! way for the same reason.
//!
//! # What waiting is
//!
//! An empty channel whose sender is still live hands the next runnable task a
//! turn and asks again. That is what makes a receive a suspension point rather
//! than a spin: the value a receiver is waiting for can only come from work
//! that has not run yet, so a receive that did not yield would be a deadlock
//! written as a loop.
//!
//! # Why one function per payload
//!
//! The wrapping is what differs: a receive answers `Ok(payload)` or
//! `Error(ChannelError.Closed)`, and the result row is minted per payload
//! type. The waiting is identical, so it is written once here and instantiated
//! per row, exactly as analysis mints one result row per payload.
