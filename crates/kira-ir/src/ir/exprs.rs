//! IR expressions: the node set every backend switches on.
//!
//! Split from the program and statement model on the file-size ladder, the way
//! `kira-semantics-model` splits its HIR. The cut is the one that keeps a
//! reader's question answerable in one file: what an expression node *is* lives
//! here, and what a program is made of lives beside it.
//!
//! [`IrProgram::expr_type`](super::IrProgram::expr_type) stays with the program
//! deliberately — it resolves a local against the enclosing function's slot
//! types, so it is a question about a program, not about a node.
