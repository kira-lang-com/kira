//! The mid-level IR: the verified, backend-facing form of a program.
//!
//! The IR is what every backend consumes. It is fully resolved and typed:
//! locals are slot indices, calls name a [`IrCallee`], and expression nodes
//! carry their [`Type`]. Nodes live in a per-program arena and reference each
//! other by [`IrExprId`], so no IR type carries a lifetime. Producing an
//! [`IrProgram`] is the contract that the program type-checked and has a valid
//! entrypoint.
