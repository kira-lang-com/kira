//! Running a VM program whose foreign half can call back into it.
//!
//! A `@FFI.Callback` value is the address of a libffi closure this session
//! prepared. When C calls through it, the closure marshals its arguments and
//! asks for a Kira function to be run — and the only thing that can run one
//! under `--backend vm` is the interpreter that is already several frames up the
//! stack, inside the foreign call C was reached from.
//!
//! # Why a session, and why a thread-local
//!
//! The interpreter is borrowed for the whole run, so the way back in cannot be a
//! second `&mut` to it. It is a *fresh* run instead: [`Program::call`] takes
//! `&self` and gives the nested call its own heap and operand stack, so the two
//! never share mutable state. That is what makes the crossing safe rather than
//! merely arranged.
//!
//! The invoker the thunk calls is a bare `extern "C" fn` with no user-data
//! pointer, so it cannot close over the session; it finds it in a thread-local
//! installed for the run's duration. A thunk called from a thread the host never
//! entered therefore finds nothing, and says so instead of running against a
//! null pointer. This is the same shape `kira-hybrid-runtime` uses for the
//! native half calling a `@Runtime` function.
