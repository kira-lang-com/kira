//! What can go wrong embedding a Kira library, and how each one is named.
//!
//! Every failure here is typed and names the thing that disagreed. That is not
//! politeness: an embedder holds an artifact it did not compile, and "the call
//! failed" gives it nowhere to look. A wrapper generated against one build of a
//! library and handed another must be able to say *which export* moved.
