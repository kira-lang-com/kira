//! The export ABI's marker, and the symbol family it guards.
//!
//! A Kira library built for the native engine exports one C-ABI trampoline per
//! `@Export`, all sharing the uniform shape the hybrid seam already load-tests.
//! Those symbols resolve **by name**, which is the failure mode worth designing
//! against: an archive built under an older contract still links, and the
//! program then calls the old code through the new ABI.
//!
//! [`RUNTIME_ABI_MARKER`](kira_runtime_abi::RUNTIME_ABI_MARKER) answers that for
//! the `kira_rt_*` helpers by baking the version into a symbol name. This module
//! applies the same trick one level up: a library defines
//! `kira_lib_<library>_abi_1`, and the generated wrapper *calls* it from
//! `load()`. The call does nothing — the function is empty and free — and that
//! is the point. A stale archive does not define this version's marker, so the
//! consumer's **link** fails naming the marker instead of the process
//! misbehaving later.
//!
//! # Two versions, deliberately separate
//!
//! [`EXPORT_ABI_VERSION`] is not
//! [`RUNTIME_ABI_VERSION`](kira_runtime_abi::RUNTIME_ABI_VERSION). They version
//! different contracts and move independently: the runtime version covers what a
//! `kira_rt_*` helper does and owns, this one covers what a `kira_lib_*`
//! trampoline's arguments mean. A library carries both markers, and either one
//! going stale fails the same way.
//!
//! # Where these names are used
//!
//! The VM engine needs none of this: it verifies data rather than symbols (see
//! [`Library::verify`](crate::Library)), because a `.kbc` embedded in a wrapper
//! crate has no link step to fail. The names here are the native engine's half
//! of the guard, defined now so both engines' guards are stated in one place and
//! pinned by one test.
