//! A native-capable host that answers `call_foreign` through libffi.
//!
//! The VM is a portable core: it marshals a foreign call to borrowed
//! [`ForeignArg`]s and asks its host, never loading or linking anything itself.
//! This is the host that says yes. It wraps another [`HostCapabilities`] for
//! `write_line` and adds a foreign half backed by the [`ForeignLibrary`]
//! handles opened from the package's resolved native libraries.
//!
//! Native-only by construction: it `dlopen`s the declared libraries, so it is
//! compiled out for `wasm32` targets. That is the same division of labour the
//! seam is built around — the VM stays portable precisely because the host is
//! not.
