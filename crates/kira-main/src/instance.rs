//! A running copy of a library: its heap, its host, and calls by name.
//!
//! [`kira_vm_runtime::Instance`] is the engine — one heap that outlives a call,
//! a root table naming what the consumer still holds. This is the *embedding*
//! surface over it, and it adds the three things a Rust program needs that the
//! portable core deliberately does not provide:
//!
//! - **It owns the host.** The core takes a `&mut dyn HostCapabilities` per
//!   call, which is right for a crate that must not assume where output goes.
//!   An embedder threading that through every generated method would be
//!   ceremony, so the instance holds it. Generic, not boxed, so an embedder that
//!   captures output can read its own host back afterwards.
//! - **It calls by name.** The core calls by function id, which is the artifact's
//!   internal numbering. A consumer knows `make_button`; resolving that through
//!   the module's own export table is what makes the id an internal detail a
//!   library may renumber.
//! - **It checks arguments before the VM sees them.** Passing a string where an
//!   integer belongs is a mistake entirely outside the library, and a trap from
//!   inside says nothing about it.
//!
//! # What is checked, and what is not
//!
//! Argument checking here is **kind-level**: integer, float, boolean, string,
//! handle. It deliberately does not check *which class* a handle denotes,
//! because a [`NativeArg::Handle`] is one word and the seam cannot see more.
//! Class typing belongs to the generated newtypes one layer up, where a
//! `Button` and a `Window` are different Rust types and the mistake cannot be
//! written. Stating the split here keeps this layer from pretending to a
//! guarantee it cannot make.
