//! The hybrid module manifest: the `.khm` artifact that ties a program's
//! bytecode half to its native half.
//!
//! A hybrid build emits three things: a bytecode module, a native shared
//! library, and this manifest describing how they fit together. The manifest is
//! what the hybrid runtime loads first — it names the two payloads, says which
//! function is the entrypoint and which engine owns it, and for every function
//! records the engine, the signature, and (for native functions) the symbol to
//! resolve out of the library.
//!
//! # Why signatures live here
//!
//! The runtime marshals every value that crosses the boundary, and it must know
//! what a function expects *before* it calls it — the native side is machine
//! code with no reflection. Types are recorded as [`BridgeValueTag`]s, the same
//! tags the values themselves carry, so the manifest and the ABI can never
//! describe two different lattices.
//!
//! # Format
//!
//! `KHM1`, little-endian, length-prefixed, append-only: never renumber a tag,
//! reorder a field, or insert one mid-record. A manifest is a deserializable
//! public artifact, so decoding validates rather than trusts.
