//! The build system: drives the frontend, then packages what a consumer needs.
//!
//! Layer 7 of the Kira package graph.
//!
//! # What lives here and why
//!
//! Two things, and they are the same thing seen from either end:
//!
//! - [`frontend`] turns a path to a `.kira` file into an
//!   [`IrProgram`](kira_ir::IrProgram) plus package-resolution and frontend
//!   diagnostics. For package-owned files it resolves transitive path
//!   dependencies and loads their modules before semantics; library packages
//!   additionally compile every source below `app/`, while a bare source file
//!   keeps the standalone behavior. It is a *library* function rather than CLI
//!   code because `kira` is not the only thing that compiles Kira: a consumer
//!   crate's `build.rs` builds the library it embeds, and it must reach the
//!   identical pipeline rather than a second one that drifts from it.
//! - [`library`] takes that program and produces what a Rust consumer actually
//!   depends on: the `.kbc` artifact, and a generated wrapper crate around it
//!   ([`wrapper`]).
//!
//! # The generated crate is code
//!
//! [`wrapper::generate`] is pure — spec in, file contents out, no filesystem —
//! so what it emits can be asserted on directly. Everything it emits is held to
//! the same bar as hand-written code here: it is `rustfmt`-shaped, it carries a
//! doc comment on every public item, and it contains no `unsafe`. The VM engine
//! needs none — the wrapper embeds bytecode and calls `kira-main` through safe
//! Rust — which is exactly why this is the engine that a consumer can build on a
//! machine with no LLVM and no linker.
//!
//! # Bindings come before analysis
//!
//! [`autobind`] generates *Kira* bindings for a native library — the opposite
//! direction from the wrapper — out of the C headers its manifest declares. It
//! runs inside [`frontend::compile_for`], before a module is loaded, for every
//! package in the dependency graph, because what it writes is Kira source the
//! analyzer reads.
