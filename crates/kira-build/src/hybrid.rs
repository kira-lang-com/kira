//! Building a Kira library for the **hybrid engine**.
//!
//! # What `@Runtime` and `@Native` mean for a library
//!
//! The split was built to serve live-reload of applications, and a library has
//! no application to reload — so what it means here is a real question rather
//! than an inherited answer. The answer is that **it means exactly what it
//! always meant: which engine runs a function's body.** What a library changes
//! is not the split but the *entry*: an application is entered at its `@Main`, a
//! library is entered by its consumer, one call at a time.
//!
//! That is what makes this engine worth building rather than a parity checkbox.
//! The VM engine compiles every function to bytecode; the native engine compiles
//! every function to machine code; neither is wrong, and neither lets the
//! library's author choose per function. **The hybrid engine is the only one
//! that honors the annotation**, so it is the only one where a library's hot
//! inner function is machine code while its surface, its handles, and its
//! strings stay on the VM.
//!
//! # Three artifacts, and where each one goes
//!
//! ```text
//! .kira-build/lib/uifoundation.kbc          the bytecode half
//! .kira-build/lib/uifoundation.khm          the split describing both halves
//! .kira-build/lib/libuifoundation.dylib     the native half
//! .kira-build/rust/uifoundation/            the crate a Rust program depends on
//! ```
//!
//! The first two are **data**, so the generated crate embeds copies of both and
//! stays relocatable exactly as the VM engine's does. The third is code a
//! process must `dlopen`, so it stays a file — which makes deployment exactly
//! one file long, and `kira_hybrid_main::locate` is where being found at load
//! time is designed.
//!
//! The manifest carries the resolved engine for every function and the exact
//! native symbol emitted for each native entry. The generated wrapper embeds
//! that manifest with the bytecode, so exports and cross-engine calls use the
//! same description at build and run time.
