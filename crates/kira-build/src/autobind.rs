//! Running manifest-declared autobind across a program's whole package graph,
//! before anything is analyzed.
//!
//! # Why here, and why before analysis
//!
//! A generated binding is Kira source: `@FFI.Extern` declarations that the
//! frontend loads with every other file of the package that owns them. So it
//! has to exist on disk before the module walk runs, or the walk reports every
//! call into that C library as an undefined function — which is what a fresh
//! checkout of a package that gitignores its bindings did.
//!
//! It runs here rather than inside program assembly for one reason: assembly
//! never writes. A language server assembles the same program on every
//! keystroke, and a keystroke must not run a C parser or touch the tree. The
//! build writes the bindings; the editor reads what the last build left, which
//! is the same file.
//!
//! # The whole graph, not just the root
//!
//! A library is declared by the package that owns it. An app importing
//! `KiraUIFoundation` declares no `kiratext`, and the bindings it needs are the
//! ones UI Foundation's own headers produce — into UI Foundation's own source
//! tree, where its own modules are compiled from. So every package in the
//! dependency closure is planned, each anchored at its own root.
