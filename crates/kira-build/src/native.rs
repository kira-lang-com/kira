//! Building a Kira library for the **native engine**, and the symbols that
//! makes visible.
//!
//! The VM engine's product is a `.kbc` plus a crate that embeds it
//! ([`crate::library`]). The native engine's product is a static archive plus a
//! crate that *links* it — the same generated API over a different engine, which
//! is the whole point: a consumer's code does not change when the engine does.
//!
//! # This module owns the symbol derivation, and nothing else does
//!
//! Every `kira_lib_*` name has one correct spelling and `kira-main` owns it.
//! Here is where that spelling is asked for, once, and handed in two directions:
//! down to the backend, which emits those symbols, and across to the generator,
//! which declares them in the consumer's `extern` block. A second derivation
//! anywhere would be a symbol-drift bug waiting for a rename.
