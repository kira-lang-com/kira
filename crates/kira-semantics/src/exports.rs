//! The `@Export` surface: which functions a library offers a consumer, what a
//! name maps to, and everything the boundary refuses.
//!
//! `@Export` is **new Kira design**, not oracle behavior — the oracle has no
//! library-export or embedding concept, and its `@FFI.*` family runs the other
//! direction entirely. What is pinned, and obeyed here, is the annotation
//! grammar the marker rides on.
//!
//! # Why the checks live in the frontend
//!
//! Every rule below has the same answer on every backend: whether a type can
//! cross the boundary is a property of the type, not of the engine that carries
//! it. Putting them here — above the backend split, beside the entrypoint rule
//! [`crate::BuildKind`] already decides — is what keeps three engines from
//! each growing their own opinion about what an export is.
//!
//! # What the boundary refuses, and why each one is a refusal
//!
//! The refusals are the standing never-travels set plus the two the export
//! boundary adds. An array is refused because who frees its elements is
//! undesigned; a struct and an enum because neither fits one tag and one word;
//! a function value because it has no crossing representation at all. A class
//! that is not itself `@Export` is refused rather than silently exported,
//! because handle-eligibility is the author's decision. `move` and
//! `borrow mut` are refused because the boundary contract is fixed per type:
//! a mutable borrow across it would promise mutation of storage the other side
//! does not manage.
//!
//! Refusing beats guessing here for the same reason `print(struct)` and
//! struct-at-the-native-seam are refused: an invented answer becomes the
//! contract the moment anything depends on it.
