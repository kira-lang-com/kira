//! Array expression analysis: literals, indexing, properties, and methods.
//!
//! # Why `.append` resolves a place and `.count` does not
//!
//! Reading an array yields an **independent value** — the runtime copies it,
//! exactly as it copies a struct. So `.count`, which only reads, can take any
//! expression: measuring a copy gives the same answer as measuring the
//! original.
//!
//! `.append` mutates. Appending to a *read* would push onto a copy that is
//! dropped a moment later, and the write would vanish with no diagnostic
//! anywhere. So its receiver is resolved to a [`HirPlace`] — a local plus a
//! walk — and the write goes through that walk into the object the local
//! actually holds. `rows[0].xs.append(42)` landing in `rows` is that
//! resolution, not an optimization on top of it.
