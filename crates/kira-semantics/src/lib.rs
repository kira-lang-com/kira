//! Semantic analyzer: the salsa frontend that turns source text into a typed
//! [`HirProgram`] plus diagnostics.
//!
//! Layer 2 of the Kira package graph.
//!
//! The frontend is built on salsa from the start so the language server and the
//! compiler share one query graph. The input is the entry file's text plus the
//! sibling modules it imports, already read from disk by the caller; the
//! tracked queries are [`expanded`] (macro expansion), [`parsed`] (lex +
//! parse), and [`analyzed`] (name resolution + type checking). Diagnostics are
//! never thrown — they are pushed into the [`DiagnosticAccumulator`], which
//! salsa propagates up the call graph, so a caller collects every diagnostic
//! from one `accumulated` call.
//!
//! # Two granularities
//!
//! [`SourceProgram`] is one input holding the whole program, and a caller that
//! re-points it starts a new revision: everything keyed on the program —
//! parsing, name resolution, type checking — is recomputed, which is what keeps
//! one compilation's declarations out of the next one's scope.
//!
//! Below that sits a per-**file** layer keyed on [`SourceFile`], an interned
//! handle whose identity is the file's own bytes. Two compilations that both
//! pull in Foundation hand the same bytes over and get the same handle, so the
//! answers already computed for it are found rather than recomputed.
//!
//! Expansion and parsing both live at that granularity. A file is parsed
//! against the base its position in the program gives it, so its handles and
//! symbols are already the program's and assembling a program renumbers
//! nothing: an unchanged dependency is parsed once per session, and the tree
//! shares its nodes by handle. Analysis does **not** live there yet — it
//! materializes one whole-program [`HirProgram`] whose `StructId`/`FuncId` are
//! flat indices into one table, so nothing about one package's analysis can be
//! reused when the program around it changes.
//!
//! # Why the caller reads the files
//!
//! Resolving `import support` to `support.kira` is a filesystem question, and
//! this crate has no filesystem: it sits below [`kira_vm_runtime`] in the
//! layering and must keep compiling for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`. So module
//! *loading* is injected — `kira-program-graph` walks the imports and hands the
//! texts in — while module *resolution* (which import binds which name, and
//! which import binds nothing) stays here, where the diagnostics belong.
