//! Where a value crosses into a wider declared type.
//!
//! One crossing lives here, and it is the language's only one: a value whose
//! type stops being known ([`Type::Any`]). [`Analyzer::admits`] answers whether
//! a position accepts a value and [`Analyzer::coerce_into`] inserts the node
//! that makes it true, and the two are one pair on purpose: a position that
//! admits a value without inserting the node would hand a backend a value in
//! the wrong machine form.
//!
//! # Why one generic specialization does not reach another
//!
//! `Result<Int, E>` is not admitted where `Result<Any, E>` is written, and
//! `Box<Child>` is not admitted where `Box<Parent>` is. A specialization's
//! identity is part of its nominal identity, and that identity reaches
//! dispatch, reflection, serialization, and the ABI, so a value that silently
//! became another specialization would answer `.type` with a type it was never
//! built as. Kira aggregates are mutable values as well, so a widening would
//! have to be a rebuild whose writes land in a copy. A program that wants the
//! other specialization builds it, one payload at a time.
//!
//! Every position that admits a value of a *declared* type routes through the
//! pair — a `let` with an annotation, an assignment, a `return`, a call
//! argument, a struct field, an enum payload, an array element. A caller may
//! route *every* value through [`Analyzer::coerce_into`] rather than deciding
//! first, which is what keeps a position from being forgotten.
//!
//! # Why this is not left to the backends
//!
//! A backend could compare each expression's type against its destination's and
//! notice the same thing. Two backends doing that independently is two chances
//! to disagree, and the disagreement would be silent: the VM would keep working
//! (its values are tagged either way) while native code read a scalar as a box
//! pointer. Making the crossing a node in the tree means both engines are handed
//! the same answer instead of deriving it.
//!
//! # The way back
//!
//! `value is T` and `value as T` ask an erased value what it holds, so the
//! crossing into `Any` is reversible by a checked downcast rather than by an
//! implicit rule. Nothing turns a `Result<Any, E>` back into a
//! `Result<Int, E>`: the payload is reachable through the downcast, and the
//! specialization is rebuilt from it.
