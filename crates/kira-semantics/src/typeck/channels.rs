//! `Channel<T>()`: an ordered handoff between two contexts.
//!
//! A channel is the language's answer to a question a program cannot otherwise
//! ask: how its own work orders against work already running somewhere else.
//! Before it, an outsider could only enqueue and hope; the lifecycle harness
//! found exactly that hole. A receive turns the ordering question into a data
//! dependency, which is the one form of it that has an answer.
//!
//! # What is minted
//!
//! Four kinds of row, all the compiler's own and none spellable in source: a
//! `Sender<T>` and a `Receiver<T>` per payload type, one `ChannelError` for the
//! whole program, and a `Result`-shaped row per payload that a receive answers
//! with. They are minted rather than taken from Foundation for the reason a
//! cast's failure is: a channel is a language construct, so a program that
//! imports nothing still writes one, and a failure it cannot name is a failure
//! it cannot handle.
//!
//! # Why the ends are `distinct` rows
//!
//! An end is one word, and it has to stay one word: an end is moved into the
//! task that uses it, and a task argument slot is a single machine word. A
//! `distinct` over `Int` is exactly that shape with a nominal identity on top,
//! so `Sender<Int>` and `Receiver<Int>` are two types and neither is the `Int`
//! underneath. Passing a receiver where a sender belongs is a type error rather
//! than a direction the runtime has to catch.
//!
//! # Why a closed channel is not a trap
//!
//! The sender being gone is an ordinary end to a conversation, not a program
//! error. A receive on a drained closed channel answers
//! `Error(ChannelError.Closed)`, which the enclosing `handle` covers like every
//! other failure. Sending to a channel whose receiver is gone *is* a trap: the
//! value has nowhere to arrive and nobody to tell.
