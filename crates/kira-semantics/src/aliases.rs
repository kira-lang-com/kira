//! Type aliases: `type Name = Target`.
//!
//! An alias is a *frontend* fact and nothing else. Analysis resolves the name
//! to the [`Type`] its target stands for, and the HIR — and therefore the IR,
//! the bytecode, both native backends and wasm — sees exactly what it would
//! have seen had the target been written out. No layer below semantics learns
//! aliases exist, which is why this feature costs no opcode and no backend
//! work.
//!
//! Resolution is lazy and memoized, because an alias may name another alias
//! (`type ByteMatrix = [ByteBuffer]`) and declaration order is not a rule for
//! aliases the way it is for struct fields. Laziness needs a cycle guard: an
//! alias caught resolving *while it is already resolving* is reported once as
//! `KSEM157` and yields [`Type::Error`], so `type A = B` / `type B = A`
//! terminates instead of recursing forever.
