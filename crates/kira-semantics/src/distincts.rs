//! `distinct Name = Representation`: registering the declarations, resolving
//! the representation, and the two crossings a program writes.
//!
//! The mirror image of [`crate::aliases`], and the two are written beside each
//! other on purpose. An alias binds a second *spelling* to one type, so a value
//! crosses between the names freely and nothing below semantics learns the
//! alias existed. A `distinct` declaration binds a second *type* to one
//! representation, so nothing crosses without being written — and nothing below
//! semantics learns that type existed either, because `kira-ir` rewrites it to
//! the representation before a backend sees the program.
//!
//! Resolution is lazy and memoized for the reason an alias's is: a declaration
//! may name another (`distinct Ticks = Millis`), and declaration order is not a
//! rule here. Laziness needs a cycle guard, so a declaration reached while it is
//! already resolving is `KSEM346` and yields [`Type::Error`].
