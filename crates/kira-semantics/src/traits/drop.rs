//! The compiler-known `Drop` trait: a body the engines run where they already
//! release the value.
//!
//! A type claims `Drop` the way it claims any trait — in its declaration's
//! conformance list, or in an `extend T: Drop { … }` block — and implements the
//! one member the trait has:
//!
//! ```kira
//! extend Handle: Drop {
//!     function drop(borrow mut self) { closeHandle(raw) }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # What the claim buys and what it costs
//!
//! The body runs once, before the type's own members are released, at every
//! point either engine releases a value of the type. That is the whole of the
//! feature, and it is why the two costs below are not options:
//!
//! * **The body is never called by name.** `value.drop()` is `KSEM300`. A
//!   release is the compiler's to schedule; a hand-written call would run the
//!   body a second time and leave the value looking alive.
//! * **The type moves rather than copies.** A copy would be a second value with
//!   the same body to run, and the release that ran it once would run it twice.
//!   So a `Copyable` claim on a `Drop` type is refused with the same diagnostic
//!   that refuses one on a `String`-bearing struct.
//!
//! # How each engine finds the body
//!
//! [`kira_semantics_model::StructDef::drop_glue`] records the function, and the
//! type table travels to both backends unchanged. The native backend calls it
//! at the head of the type's release leaf; the VM records it on the heap object
//! at construction and runs it when the last holder goes, which is what makes
//! "exactly once" a runtime fact rather than a hope about where a value ended
//! up.
