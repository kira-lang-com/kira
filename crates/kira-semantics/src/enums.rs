//! Enum declaration and use: the enum table, leading-dot construction, and the
//! tag-comparison desugar for `==`/`!=`.
//!
//! # Why equality is a desugar, not a new operator
//!
//! Two enum values are equal when their discriminants are — the corpus compares
//! only payload-less variants, and the reference compares tags even for
//! payload-carrying enums. So `e == .V` is lowered here to an `Int` comparison
//! of two tags: [`crate::analyze::Analyzer::enum_tag_operand`] reads one tag off
//! each side and the existing `EqInt`/`NeInt` does the rest. No backend learns
//! that enum equality exists — it *is* integer equality by the time one sees it.
//!
//! A payload-less variant literal folds to the tag constant directly, so the
//! common `c == .Red` never allocates a throwaway enum just to read its tag.
