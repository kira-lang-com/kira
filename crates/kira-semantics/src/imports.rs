//! File-scoped import resolution: which module each file may name, and under
//! what root.
//!
//! An import binds a **namespace root** in exactly one file. `import support as
//! Support` in `main.kira` lets *that file* write `Support.hello()`; a sibling
//! that wants the same spelling writes its own import. That is the whole rule,
//! and it is why the table is keyed by [`SourceId`] rather than being a single
//! program-wide map.
//!
//! # What an import gates
//!
//! Visibility is keyed by **owner package**, so an import decides whether
//! another package's declarations are nameable here at all — bare or qualified.
//! Three rules, and nothing else ([`ImportTable::sees`]):
//!
//! * **One program is one flat scope.** Every top-level declaration in an app
//!   or library is visible bare in every one of its own files, so `import
//!   support` never changes whether a sibling's `hello()` resolves.
//! * **A dependency arrives through an import.** Importing any module of a
//!   package makes what that package declares nameable in *that file*.
//! * **Visibility does not compose.** What a dependency itself imports stays
//!   its own business: importing `Outer` never lends you `Inner`, and an import
//!   written in one file gates that file only.
//!
//! Without the third rule a program's vocabulary is whatever its dependency
//! graph happens to reach, and two packages that each declare a `Text` become
//! one name that the loader order picks between.
//!
//! # Cycles are not an error
//!
//! Two modules that import each other resolve fine: loading is
//! visited-set-guarded, so a cycle terminates instead of diverging, and both
//! files end up in the program exactly once. The oracle accepts this, so no
//! cycle diagnostic is invented here — rejecting a program the reference
//! accepts would be a worse bug than the one it would catch.
