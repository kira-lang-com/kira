//! Statement analysis: one [`Stmt`] of syntax into typed [`HirStmt`]s.
//!
//! Split from [`crate::analyze`], which keeps program-, function-, and
//! struct-level orchestration; everything here works inside one function body,
//! against one [`FnCtx`].
//!
//! # Desugaring happens here
//!
//! `for` becomes the one loop shape the HIR has ([`HirStmt::While`]), and a
//! `switch` and a `match` become chains of [`HirStmt::If`]. `attempt` is the
//! deliberate exception: it carries a linear sequence of guarded steps into
//! the HIR and IR so a long run of `try` bindings does not become a deeply
//! nested success tree. The backends learn that one structured region, but not
//! any of the source parser's contextual syntax.
//!
//! `match` is the case that shows where the limit of a desugar sits: the
//! control flow costs nothing, but binding a variant's payload needed one new
//! *expression* ([`kira_semantics_model::HirExpr::EnumPayload`]) that every
//! backend does have to implement. One node beat one statement form in every
//! layer. See [`matches`] for the shape.
//!
//! That is the first thing to try when adding syntax: a construct the HIR can
//! already express costs a rewrite here instead of a node in every layer.
