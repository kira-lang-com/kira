//! Resolving a written expression to a [`HirPlace`]: a local plus a walk.
//!
//! A place is what a write goes *through*. Reading a value copies it, so a
//! write has to name storage rather than a value — that is what a place is, and
//! it is why an assignment target and an `append` receiver both come here.
//!
//! # Every step must be writable, not just the last
//!
//! `b.size.x = 1` rewrites the `size` field's contents in place, so a `let`
//! anywhere along the path makes the whole write illegal. The walk checks each
//! step as it goes rather than checking only where it lands.
