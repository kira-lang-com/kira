//! Building this checkout into an installed dev toolchain.
//!
//! `knvm binstall` is the developer's install route: it compiles the compiler
//! out of the checkout it is run inside, shapes the result into the same tree a
//! release archive unpacks to — `bin/kira` with `foundation/` beside it — and
//! lands it on the `dev` channel through the same staging/validate/rename
//! pipeline a release install uses. Installing selects it, so `kira` dispatches
//! to the fresh build immediately.
//!
//! It builds OPTIMIZED by default. A dev toolchain is what every project in the
//! tree then compiles through, and an unoptimized compiler turns a UI library's
//! build from one minute into eight — the cost lands on every downstream build,
//! all day, not on the one command that produced it. `--debug` stages the
//! unoptimized build for the case that wants it: debugging the compiler itself.
//!
//! Running it again replaces the installed tree. A dev toolchain names a
//! moving target, so "already installed" would mean "silently stale" — the
//! one thing a rebuild command must never be.
