//! The hybrid half of `build` and `run`: emitting a bundle, and running it.
//!
//! A hybrid build writes three artifacts into `.kira-build/`, from one IR:
//!
//! - `<stem>.kbc` — the bytecode half, every non-`@Native` function,
//! - `lib<stem>.dylib` (or `.so`) — the native half, one trampoline per
//!   reachable `@Native` function,
//! - `<stem>.khm` — the manifest tying them together, which a run loads first.
//!
//! # Where the manifest is built, and why not here
//!
//! In `kira-build`, alongside the hybrid *library* build, which needs the
//! identical description of the identical program. Two spellings of "describe
//! this program as a `.khm`" would be one too many — the manifest is what every
//! crossing marshals against, and a disagreement between an application's and a
//! library's is precisely the class of bug the runtime's bundle validation
//! exists to catch. So this module composes artifacts and paths, and asks
//! [`kira_build::hybrid_manifest`] what the program is.
//!
//! # Agreeing with both halves
//!
//! Every engine assignment resolves `Inherited` against
//! [`Execution::Runtime`](kira_runtime_abi::Execution::Runtime), exactly as
//! `kira_bytecode::compile_hybrid` and the LLVM backend's `build_hybrid` do. The
//! three must agree function for function.
