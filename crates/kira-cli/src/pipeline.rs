//! What every compiling verb shares: options, discovery, the frontend, and the
//! target each of them compiles for.
//!
//! The verbs themselves live beside this: the ones that start a program in
//! [`commands`], the ones that produce an artifact in [`artifacts`], the engine
//! each of them runs on in [`execute`], and `lint` in [`lint`].
//!
//! All of them resolve a `.kira` file or package directory, drive the salsa
//! frontend to collect diagnostics, and render any errors readably against the source. `check`
//! stops there. `run` and `build` continue into the backend `--backend`
//! selects, on the device `--device` selects.
//!
//! `--device` is an override. On the host, `--backend` picks the engine; a
//! Web device has exactly one code generator, so naming the device decides
//! the backend, and a differing `--backend` beside it is overridden aloud —
//! never served, never silently swapped. `--target <arch-os-abi>` is the third
//! way of naming a machine and behaves the same way: it is the LLVM backend or
//! nothing, because the interpreter runs bytecode here and not on an aarch64
//! box somewhere else.
//!
//! The backends:
//!
//! - `vm` compiles the verified IR to bytecode; `run` executes it on the VM
//!   with the [`StdoutHost`](kira_main::StdoutHost),
//! - `llvm` compiles the same IR to a native object and links an executable;
//!   `run` then executes that,
//! - `hybrid` splits the same IR on its `@Runtime`/`@Native` annotations and
//!   emits both halves plus a manifest; `run` loads the bundle and runs it in
//!   this process, which is the host.
//!
//! On a `wasm32`/`wasm64` device, the wasm backend turns the whole program
//! into machine code for that device exactly as LLVM does for this one,
//! emitting a module plus the page that runs it; `run` serves them and opens a
//! browser.
//!
//! Every backend consumes the same [`IrProgram`], which is what makes their
//! observable behavior comparable — and what the parity tests check.
