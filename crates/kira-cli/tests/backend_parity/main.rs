//! Differential tests: the VM, the LLVM/native backend, and the hybrid bundle
//! must not disagree.
//!
//! Parity is proven, not asserted. Each case compiles one program through every
//! backend from the same IR and requires identical program output and exit
//! status — that is the whole contract a Kira user sees, so a divergence here
//! is a real bug in one of them.
//!
//! # What each backend does with an annotation
//!
//! `--backend vm` compiles every function to bytecode and `--backend llvm`
//! makes every function native: an execution boundary needs two engines, and
//! these builds have one, so both ignore `@Runtime`/`@Native` entirely. Only
//! `--backend hybrid` splits a program on them. That is what makes these three
//! comparable on *any* program: the annotations change where code runs without
//! changing what it does, and a case here that says otherwise is a bug.
//!
//! So an unannotated case exercises no crossing on any backend, hybrid
//! included — it compiles to a single engine like the other two. The annotated
//! cases are the ones that build a real boundary, and they are still parity
//! tests: agreeing with `vm` and `llvm`, which ignored the annotations, is the
//! statement that a boundary changed where the code ran and nothing else.
//!
//! These only run when `kira` was built with its `llvm` feature; without it
//! there is no native backend to compare against.
