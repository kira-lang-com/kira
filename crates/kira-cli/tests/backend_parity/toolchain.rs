//! Foundation's toolchain — `Kira.check`, `Kira.build`, `Kira.runApp` — driven
//! from a Kira program.
//!
//! The sibling of [`super::compiler`], and where it differs is the whole point.
//! Checking a package set held in memory needs only the frontend, which links
//! into a native binary, so that surface answers the same on every backend.
//! Driving the toolchain over a project on a disk needs the build system, and a
//! standalone native binary does not carry one. So these cases prove two
//! things: under the `kira` host — the VM and the hybrid runtime — the verbs
//! answer with the program's own diagnostics and its exit code; and a
//! standalone native build refuses by name rather than answering as though the
//! package compiled.
