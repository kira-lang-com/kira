//! The in-depth stress harness, run through the real binary.
//!
//! `tests-kik/harness` is one Kira package that exercises the executable
//! surface in depth: fifteen areas, over a thousand `Test` declarations, and a
//! `@Main` that reduces every area to a checksum. It is the corpus the
//! reference implementation used as its own stress suite, ported here as Kira
//! source — behavior, never internals.
//!
//! Two things are gated, and they catch different failures. The suite catches a
//! *wrong value*: a case computes something and asserts what it should be. The
//! checksum run catches a *backend divergence*: the same program printing
//! different bytes on two engines is a parity bug even when every case passes,
//! because a case only looks at what it thought to look at.
