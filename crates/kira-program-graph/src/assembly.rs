//! Program assembly: the whole source set an entry file compiles as.
//!
//! Loading the modules an entry file imports is only part of the answer. When
//! that file belongs to a package, the program is also every dependency the
//! package's `package.kira` resolves to and every sibling `.kira` file below
//! the package's source root — an `app/main.kira` that never imports
//! `app/area/Thing.kira` is still compiled with it.
//!
//! # Why this is not the build's private business
//!
//! Two callers assemble the same program: `kira build` and the language
//! server. When only the build knew about manifests, an editor opening
//! `app/main.kira` analyzed it as a lone file — every dependency import
//! reported as an unresolved library, every sibling declaration reported as
//! undefined — while `kira check` on the same tree was clean. A squiggle that
//! disagrees with the compiler is worse than no squiggle, so the discovery,
//! resolution, and aggregation all live here, above the module walk and below
//! both callers.
//!
//! # What it does not do
//!
//! It never writes. Resolution reports a drifted `kira.lock` as a diagnostic
//! and hands the graph back; whether to rewrite the file is the caller's call,
//! and a language server answering a keystroke must not touch the tree.
