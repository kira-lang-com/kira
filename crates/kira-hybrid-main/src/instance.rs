//! A running hybrid library: one heap, two engines, and the host between them.
//!
//! # What `@Runtime` and `@Native` mean when there is no `@Main`
//!
//! Exactly what they have always meant: **which engine runs a function's body.**
//! That is the whole answer, and it is worth stating plainly because the split
//! was built to serve live-reload of applications, and a library has no
//! application to reload.
//!
//! What a library changes is not the split but the *entry*. An application is
//! entered at its `@Main`, on whichever engine owns it. A library is entered by
//! its consumer, one call at a time — and the consumer always enters through the
//! **bytecode half**. So:
//!
//! - `@Runtime` (the default) — the body is bytecode, run on this instance's VM.
//! - `@Native` — the body is machine code in the shared library, reached from
//!   Kira through the seam exactly as it is in an application.
//! - `@Export` — the consumer-facing surface, and it names *runtime* functions.
//!   An `@Export` that is also `@Native` is refused at build time, by name; see
//!   below.
//!
//! That combination is what makes this engine worth having rather than a parity
//! checkbox. A VM-engine library compiles every function to bytecode; a
//! native-engine library compiles every function to machine code. The hybrid
//! engine is the only one where an author can put the hot inner function in
//! machine code and keep the surface — and the handles, and the strings — on the
//! VM, which is what the `@Native` annotation was for in the first place.
//!
//! # Why an exported function may not itself be `@Native`
//!
//! Handles. A handle is a root into *this instance's* heap: `make_button`
//! returns a `Button` because the VM rooted the object it built and handed back
//! a ticket. Machine code has no access to that heap and no way to mint a root
//! in it, so a `@Native` export returning a class would have to allocate in a
//! second heap, and the consumer would be holding two different things behind
//! one `Button` newtype — with one destructor. Refused at build time rather than
//! papered over, and refused for the whole surface rather than only for the
//! exports that happen to mention a class, because "this export may be `@Native`
//! and that one may not" is a rule nobody can hold in their head.
//!
//! # Why native code may not call back into the runtime here
//!
//! [`kira_main::Instance::call`] takes `&mut self` — it owns a heap, which is
//! the whole reason a handle can outlive a call. A native function calling back
//! into a `@Runtime` function *from inside* an exported call would need a second
//! `&mut` to the same instance, which is not a borrow that can be taken. An
//! application's hybrid session has no such problem because it runs on a
//! [`Program`](kira_vm_runtime::Program), which holds no heap and calls through
//! `&self`.
//!
//! So this engine installs **no runtime invoker**, and a hybrid library whose
//! native half calls a `@Runtime` function is refused at build time, by
//! function name. The C-level backstop is already there and already loud: with
//! no invoker installed, `kira_hybrid_call_runtime` names the function and
//! aborts rather than calling a null pointer.
