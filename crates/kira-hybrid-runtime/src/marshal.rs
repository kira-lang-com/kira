//! Marshalling across the seam, and who frees what.
//!
//! Both directions speak [`BridgeValue`] on the wire and the VM's safe
//! vocabulary ([`NativeArg`]/[`NativeResult`]) on this side. The tricky half is
//! not the encoding — it is ownership, which no compiler checks here and which
//! the generated code fixes rather than negotiates. The rules, each read out of
//! the codegen rather than out of the manifest:
//!
//! - **A native callee frees its string arguments.** `emit_return` frees every
//!   `String` local, and parameters occupy the leading locals. So
//!   [`lower_args`] builds a fresh handle per string and does *not* free it: the
//!   callee did.
//! - **A trampoline's result belongs to the host.** So [`lift_result`] copies
//!   the bytes out and frees the handle.
//! - **Args to a runtime call are transferred too.** `lower_runtime_call` writes
//!   handles into the array and never frees them after the call, so
//!   [`take_args`] takes ownership: read the bytes, free the handle.
//! - **A result the invoker returns must be a fresh handle**, which the native
//!   caller frees as an ordinary expression value. So [`lower_result`] allocates
//!   one out of the library's own allocator.
