//! Lowering a verified [`IrProgram`] into an LLVM module, and emitting it as a
//! native object.
//!
//! This module owns the LLVM objects (context, module, builder) and the
//! program-wide scaffold: one declaration per Kira function, and the plan for
//! which engine owns which body. The pieces around it each own one job:
//!
//! - [`types`] — the LLVM types Kira's values map onto, and the `kira_rt_*`
//!   declarations,
//! - [`lower`] — statement and expression lowering, which must agree with the
//!   interpreter instruction for instruction,
//! - [`entry`] — how the module is entered: a C `main`, or host trampolines,
//! - [`bridge`] — packing and unpacking values that cross between engines,
//! - [`symbols`] — the native symbol each function is emitted under,
//! - [`target`] — the target machine, host or cross, and object emission,
//! - [`ffi`] — glue for the LLVM C API's strings.
//!
//! Every LLVM object here is a raw pointer from the C API, so the whole module
//! is one `unsafe` fence: [`Module`] owns its context and disposes of it on
//! drop, and no LLVM reference escapes that lifetime.
