//! The per-element-type clone and free leaves an array's runtime helpers call.
//!
//! `kira_rt_array_clone` and `kira_rt_array_free` keep the *loop* — walking the
//! item block is ordinary Rust in `kira-native-bridge`, where it needs no basic
//! blocks and no phi nodes. What they cannot know is how to clone or free one
//! element, because that depends on the Kira type. So the backend emits a leaf
//! per element type and hands it over as a function pointer.
//!
//! ```text
//!   kira.elem.clone.<n>(src: ptr, dst: ptr)   // *dst = copy(*src)
//!   kira.elem.free.<n>(at: ptr)               // drop(*at)
//! ```
//!
//! # Why a null pointer is the common case
//!
//! An element that owns nothing needs neither leaf: the flat `memcpy` a clone
//! starts with is already a correct copy of an `Int`, and freeing one is
//! nothing. So `[Int]` passes null for both, and the runtime skips its loop
//! entirely. Only `[String]`, `[SomeStruct]`, and `[[Element]]` cost a leaf — which
//! is the same line `owns_heap` already draws everywhere else.
//!
//! # Memoized per type
//!
//! Two arrays of the same element share one leaf. The cache is keyed by the
//! element type rather than the array type, so `[Int]` and a `[[Int]]`'s inner
//! `[Int]` do not emit it twice.
