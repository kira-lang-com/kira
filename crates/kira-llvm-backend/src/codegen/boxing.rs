//! The runtime box: how an enum value and an erased `Any` are built and read.
//!
//! One module because they are one box. A Kira enum on the native side is a tag,
//! a payload kind saying what the payload word owns, and that word; an `Any` is
//! those same three fields with the tag naming the *type* that was erased rather
//! than a variant. They share their construction, their payload encoding, and —
//! through `kira_rt_enum_clone`/`kira_rt_enum_free` — everything that copies and
//! releases them, so splitting them apart would leave two places to disagree
//! about what a payload word means.
//!
//! These sit on [`Codegen`] rather than on one function's lowering because a box
//! is built from generated glue as well as from an expression
//! ([`super::lower::FunctionLowering`]), and glue has no Kira function in
//! scope at all.
