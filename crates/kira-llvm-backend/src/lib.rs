//! LLVM/native backend: compiles Kira IR to machine code via LLVM.
//!
//! Layer 4 of the Kira package graph.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! The backend consumes the same verified [`IrProgram`] the VM's bytecode
//! compiler does and lowers it *in process* through the LLVM C API
//! (`llvm-sys`), emitting a real object file with LLVM's own target machine —
//! no textual-IR round trip and no `clang -x ir` subprocess in the codegen
//! path. `clang` from the managed toolchain is used only as the linker driver.
//!
//! # Parity
//!
//! Native code must behave exactly as the VM does on the same program, so the
//! lowering mirrors the interpreter's semantics rather than taking the
//! shortcuts a C compiler would:
//!
//! - integer arithmetic wraps (no `nsw`/`nuw`), matching the VM's `wrapping_*`,
//! - `/` and `%` by zero call the runtime's trap helper, and `MIN / -1` is
//!   special-cased to the wrapping result instead of LLVM's poison,
//! - `print` and all string work go through the stable `kira_rt_*` helpers in
//!   `kira-native-bridge`, which format with the same standard library the VM
//!   uses — so output is identical byte-for-byte.
//!
//! # Standing decisions
//!
//! - LLVM is reached through `llvm-sys`, never `inkwell`.
//! - LLVM is a hard dependency: every build of this crate carries the backend,
//!   and a machine without a managed LLVM does not build the workspace. The
//!   `verifying-work` provisioning notes name the fix.
//! - `unsafe` is fenced to this crate's binding layer, with a `// SAFETY:`
//!   comment on every block.
