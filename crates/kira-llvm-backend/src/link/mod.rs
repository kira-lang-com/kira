//! Linking native executables and shared libraries.
//!
//! Codegen happens in process through LLVM; `clang` is used only here, as the
//! linker driver, and always the `clang` from the discovered LLVM install
//! rather than whatever is on `PATH` — the same explicit-toolchain rule the
//! rest of the backend follows. That one driver links for every machine Kira
//! emits for: clang is a cross compiler by construction, so aiming it at
//! another target is `--target=` plus a `--sysroot` holding that machine's
//! libraries, not a second toolchain.
//!
//! The link inputs are the program's object files and the native runtime archive
//! (`libkira_native_bridge.a`), which is a Rust `staticlib` and therefore carries
//! the Rust standard library with it; the driver supplies the system libraries
//! around it. A cross link needs that archive built for the target as well —
//! the Rust standard library inside it is machine code like any other — which
//! is why the caller resolves it per target rather than naming one file.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! - [`error`] — every way a link, an archive, or a symbol read can fail.
//! - [`target`] — which machine is being linked for, and its sysroot.
//! - [`driver`] — the flags, the response file, and the staged runtime files.
//! - [`libraries`] — the shared, live, hybrid, and static-archive artifacts.
//! - [`carrier`] — the host-only shared carrier for static FFI archives.
//!
//! What stays here is the executable link and [`link_with`], the one function
//! that actually spawns the driver.
