//! This script supplies what it no longer does: it locates the bundle through
//! `kira-toolchain`'s discovery — `KIRA_LLVM_HOME` override first, then the
//! managed install under `~/.kira/toolchains/llvm/<pinned>/<host>` — and asks
//! that bundle's own `llvm-config` for the link line. So a plain `cargo
//! build` in any shell, editor, or CI job finds LLVM through Kira's code,
//! with nothing exported and nothing on PATH.
