//! The shapes the channel surface is built from.
//!
//! Analysis mints the rows and both backends read the representation, so the
//! names and the wire meaning of a handle word are stated once here rather
//! than rediscovered in three places.
//!
//! # Why the ends are distinct types
//!
//! A channel end is one machine word: an index into the table the runtime
//! owns. Minting each end as a `distinct` over `Int` gives it a nominal
//! identity the type checker keeps apart from every other number, and gives it
//! scalar layout for free. Scalar layout is not a convenience here, it is the
//! requirement: an end is moved into the task that uses it, and a task
//! argument slot is one word.
//!
//! A `Sender<Int>` and a `Receiver<Int>` are therefore two rows, and neither
//! is the `Int` underneath: passing a receiver where a sender belongs is a
//! type error rather than a direction the runtime has to catch.

/// The module the minted rows are attributed to.
///
/// Not Foundation's and not spellable in source: a channel is a language
/// construct, so a program that imports nothing still writes one.
