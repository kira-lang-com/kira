//! What a runtime type descriptor holds, and the table that hands them out.
//!
//! # Why a table and not a hash
//!
//! Runtime type equality is exact nominal identity equality, and `value.type`
//! has to answer with a name, a package, a kind, and the arguments an
//! instantiation was minted with. A hash of the identity string would give
//! comparison and nothing else, and would trade exactness for a collision
//! probability in the one place a collision is a wrong answer rather than a
//! slow one. A table gives both: an index compares in one instruction, and the
//! row beside it carries what the descriptor exposes.
//!
//! # Why identities are strings and indexes are not
//!
//! An index is meaningful only inside one compiled program, which is enough for
//! every question asked *during* a run: the bytecode half, the native half, and
//! the hybrid bundle of one program are built from one table. Anything that
//! outlives a build — a hot-reload compatibility check, a serialized schema, an
//! ABI record — compares [`TypeDescriptor::identity`], which is the
//! package-qualified identity key and is stable across builds.
//!
//! # Distincts
//!
//! A distinct keeps its own row even though `kira-ir` rewrites it to its
//! representation before a backend sees a program. The rewrite is about the
//! machine form of the value; the identity is what the language says the value
//! *is*, and the two are deliberately different questions.
