//! Call frames: entering a function, filling its parameter slots, and writing
//! its written-through parameters back into the caller.
//!
//! Split from the dispatch loop on the file-size ladder. What is here is the
//! *shape* of a call — how a frame comes into existence, what it owes the
//! caller when it returns, and who frees what on every path out. The loop that
//! executes instructions between those two moments stays in [`super`].
//!
//! Ownership is the reason this is one module rather than three helpers. Every
//! path here either moves a value into a slot or frees it, and the cases that
//! look like edges — a refused call, a mid-fill failure, a malformed writeback
//! place — are the ones where a leak or a double free would hide. Keeping them
//! together is what makes that reviewable.
