//! A loaded library with a heap that outlives one call.
//!
//! [`Program::call`](crate::Program::call) runs each call on a fresh
//! [`Heap`] and drops it at the end, which is right for the hybrid seam — the
//! native half asks a question and gets an answer — and wrong for a library. A
//! library is asked for a `Button` and then asked about that same `Button`
//! later, and Kira has no globals, so there is nowhere for the object to live
//! between the two calls. [`Instance`] is that somewhere.
//!
//! # Roots are the whole idea
//!
//! An instance owns one heap for its whole life, plus a **root table**: the set
//! of values the consumer still holds a name for. A call that produces an object
//! roots it and hands back a [`RootId`]; [`Instance::release`] un-roots it and
//! frees what it owned. Everything else the call allocated is freed by the call,
//! exactly as it always was.
//!
//! Root ids are minted from a counter and **never reused**. That is the one
//! property that makes a released handle a *typed error*
//! ([`VmError::DanglingRoot`]) rather than a silent hit on whatever object later
//! took that heap slot — a wrong answer about which object is a use-after-free,
//! and this is the design that makes one unrepresentable.
//!
//! # What a handle argument does
//!
//! It is **copied in**, not lent. A class is a value type in Kira — passing one
//! to a function copies it, and the export boundary refuses `move` and
//! `borrow mut` on a parameter for exactly that reason — so a copy is what the
//! language already means, and it keeps the affine drop discipline intact: the
//! callee owns its copy and frees it at return, while the root keeps owning the
//! original. Mutation inside the call is not visible to the consumer afterwards,
//! which is the same answer Kira gives a Kira caller.
//!
//! # What "balanced" means now
//!
//! When a heap belongs to one run, balanced means `current == 0` at exit. A heap
//! that outlives a call cannot say that between calls — a live root is *supposed*
//! to hold storage. So the invariant moves out one level:
//!
//! > **Between calls, everything live in the heap is owned by a live root.**
//!
//! which is checkable, and [`Instance::finish`] is where it is checked: it
//! releases every remaining root and returns the heap's accounting, and
//! `current` is 0 for an instance that balanced. An instance that never roots
//! anything reduces to the old rule — `finish` reports 0 after every call —
//! and a call that *traps* still balances, because a trap unwinds its frames and
//! operand stack into the heap it borrowed rather than abandoning them.
//!
//! That holds for **every** trap a validating module can reach, not only the
//! ones a Kira compiler emits. [`Module::validate`](kira_bytecode::Module) proves
//! structure, not stack typing, so an ill-typed `.kbc` from anywhere can trap
//! with a heap value already popped into a local the unwind cannot see — which
//! is why each such path frees what it holds before it returns. When the heap
//! died with the call that stranding was invisible; here it would be a permanent
//! leak that [`finish`](Instance::finish) reports forever, and later steps read
//! `finish().current == 0` as proof of balance.
