//! Runtime values and the object heap with affine drop accounting.
//!
//! Scalars (`Int`, `Float`, `Bool`, `Void`) are `Copy` and live inline in a
//! [`Value`]. Strings and structs live on a [`Heap`]; a [`Value::Str`] or
//! [`Value::Struct`] is a handle into it. Both follow value semantics with
//! affine drops: reading a local *copies* it (a fresh allocation, deep for a
//! struct) and every instruction that consumes one *frees* it, so a well-formed
//! run ends with [`HeapStats::current`] at zero.
//!
//! A struct is a plain tuple of values: the VM is structurally typed, so it
//! never learns a struct's name or its field names. The compiler resolved those
//! to indices, which is what lets the same heap serve both kinds of object.
//!
//! # Arrays copy when they are written, not when they are read
//!
//! An array's elements are the one thing here that is *shared*: copying an
//! array takes a new slot pointing at the same elements, and a write through
//! either one gives the writer elements of its own first
//! ([`Heap::make_array_unique`]). Nothing observable changes — the two arrays
//! behave exactly as two deep copies — but reading an array stops costing the
//! whole array, which is what an interpreted UI frame is mostly made of. The
//! native runtime shares an array's item block on the same terms; this is one
//! design serving both engines rather than two.
