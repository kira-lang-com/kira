//! A declaration's body, as statements a macro can walk.
//!
//! Everything else in the reflection API is a *locating scan* over tokens (see
//! [`crate::decl`]), because everything else is about a declaration's shape:
//! its name, its fields, the text it covers. A body is different — the
//! questions worth asking about one are structural (*is this `while` counting
//! an index by hand?*, *does this `match` end in a catch-all?*), and a token
//! scan cannot answer those without becoming a parser badly.
//!
//! So this reuses the real parser. The declaration's own source text is a
//! complete declaration, so parsing it needs no wrapper and no reconstruction.
//!
//! # Spans survive the round trip
//!
//! Parsing detached text yields offsets into *that text*, which point nowhere
//! in any file. They are recoverable because `Declaration.syntax` is the exact
//! source slice the declaration covers: adding the declaration's own start to a
//! local offset lands on the same byte in the real file. That is what lets a
//! lint reporting a statement underline the statement rather than the whole
//! declaration.
